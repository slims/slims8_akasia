#. Previously overlooked - required for Admin. menu list. This could also be translated as "Authority Files" or "Authority Lists", because it takes the user to the  management section dealing with Authority files for Subjects, Publishers etc. ; But it also contains management of content files and others, so I think "Master Files" is more accurate.
msgid "Master File"
msgstr "Master files"

#. previously overlooked, now included. This phrase relates to the System Module section "Content", where staff can add pages of web content ( Library information for example ) for display within  OPAC template. Technically the term 'Path' refers to a file name + the directories it is in - although in this case it's not strictly true, since the data is held inside the database, not as a separate file. So the Myanamar equivalent to 'Filename' or 'Content name' would be acceptable too. We still need to say '(Must be unique)' or ' - Must be unique' as well.
